## Project Files
This project contains the following files:
1. ABEGYAH MATTHEW_SQL_PROJECT_BACKUP: SQL file containing the backup of the database.
2. ABEGYAH MATTHEW_SQL_PROJECT_QUERY: SQL file containing the queries used to interact with the database.
3. ABEGYAH MATTHEW_MICROSOFT SQL_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION: PDF documentation that provides an overview of the database structure, design decisions, and implementation details.

## Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
1. MySQL Workbench or a similar MySQL client
2. MySQL Server installed on your machine or use a remote MySQL server

## Steps
1. Clone or download the repository containing the project files.
2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.
3. Import the Backup:
    * Open the ABEGYAH MATTHEW_SQL_PROJECT_BACKUP file in MySQL Workbench.
    * Run the script to restore the database from the backup.
4. Run the Queries:
    * Open the ABEGYAH MATTHEW_SQL_PROJECT_QUERY file in MySQL Workbench.
    * Execute the queries to interact with the database (e.g., retrieving, updating, or inserting data).
5 Review the ABEGYAH MATTHEW_MICROSOFT SQL_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION for detailed explanations of the database schema, structure, and any key design decisions.

## Usage
Once the database is set up, you can use the queries provided in the ABEGYAH MATTHEW_SQL_PROJECT_QUERY file to:
 * Retrieve data
 * Update records
 * Add new entries to the database
 * Perform any necessary administrative tasks like backups or restores
The backup file allows you to restore the database to its previous state if needed.
