## Project Overview
The Travel Aggregator Analysis project focuses on analyzing data collected from different travel aggregator platforms. The project aims to uncover valuable insights that can help improve the user experience, enhance travel recommendations, and support data-driven decision-making.

Key Objectives:
* Analyze customer travel preferences and trends.
* Visualize data through interactive plots.
* Generate actionable insights from the dataset.

## Technologies Used
* Python: Programming language used for data analysis.
* Jupyter Notebook: Platform used for creating and executing the analysis.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.
* NumPy: For numerical computations.

## Project Files
1. Travel_Aggregator_Analysis.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code, analysis, and visualizations.
* Bookings.csv: The dataset used for analysis.
* Sessions.csv: The dataset used for analysis.

## Setup Instructions
Prerequisites: 
* Python 3.x installed on your machine.
* Jupyter Notebook installed (can be installed via Anaconda or pip).
Install required Python libraries:
* pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

## Steps
* Clone or download the repository.
* Install the required libraries using the command above.
* Open the Travel_Aggregator_Analysis.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
* Run the notebook to see the analysis results and visualizations.

## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can:
* Review the analysis and insights generated from the data.
* Modify the code to explore different aspects of the dataset.
* Add more visualizations or analyses as required.

## Results and Analysis
In this section, you can briefly describe the main findings from the project:
* Key trends and patterns observed in customer preferences.
* Visualizations generated (charts, graphs, etc.).
* Insights derived from the analysis that could be useful for business decisions.
